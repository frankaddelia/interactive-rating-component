## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS

### What I (re)learned

It's been a while since I've built a page using SASS/vanilla javascript (I've been getting spoiled in the React/MUI world at my current job) so it was good to relearn how to do this from scratch. 

### Continued development

I would like to redo this project using something like MUI or bootstrap and React so that I can test out the skills I've been developing at my current position.
